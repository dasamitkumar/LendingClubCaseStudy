## General Information

The objective of the exercose is to identify factors or parameters which can potentially lead to a loan in 'charged off' status to reduce the financial loss. The case study would be done using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset loan.csv. 

As an outcome, the Case study will provide strong indicators which the Institution can use to reject a loan application as a potential defaulter.

The dataset is provided by the business which corresponds to about 40k loan applicants, with mixed statuses "Fully-Paid", "Charged-Off" and "Current". We will filter only the "Charged-Off" rows as we have to determine drivers for defaulters.
